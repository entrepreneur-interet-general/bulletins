# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome**. Most active contributors will be credited in the README. We accept contributions via pull requests on GitHub.

## Pull Requests

- **[PSR-2 Coding Standard.](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)** The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install [PHP CS Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer).
- **Ask before working on a feature.** Before spending hours on a feature, open an issue and let's discuss about it.
- **Add tests!** Patches get accepted only when they include tests.
- **Document any change in behaviour.** Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- **Create feature branches.** Small fixes can be pulled from your master branch, but features needs to be pulled from a feature branch.
- **One pull request per feature.** If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
- **Send coherent history.** Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.

*Happy coding!*
